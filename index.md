# **Sun Country Segmentation Analysis**

In this group project, our goal is to analysis and visualize the segmentation of Sun Country Airline using the K-Means Clustering method.

We visualized the segment data using Tableau, identifying their key characteristics.

## Take Aways

Segment 1: Young adults booking one way tickets - multiple reasons could be behind it like students graduating and going back home, students starting school in MSP
* 2 free check in bags if you are a student or a fresh graduate
* Promote booking via website (gain more points on your account during Q3 if you book through the
website)

Segment 2: Seniors booking through SCA Website, trying to escape cold weather to vacation places like Las Vegas or Cancun - round trips after Christmas(Q1)
* Partner up with local hotels to get cheaper rooms
* Vacation coupons
 
Segment 3: From the age group we could infer that married couples with grown up children book round trip vacations from Minnesota to Las Vegas, Orlando or Cancun in Q1. They prefer using outside booking source.
* Valentines/couple get aways coupons if you book through SCA Website

Segment 4: Very similar analysis to segment 2 with only difference in increased activity during Q4
(Christmas or Thanksgiving get away)
* Similar advice to segment 2 with more emphasis on trips during New Yearâ€™s Eve and Christmas

Segment 5: Seniors going back home for retirement or older people moving out of metropolitan cities
(JFK,SFO,LAX)
* More benefits for people over 65 (cheaper flights, priority booking, cheaper first class tickets)
